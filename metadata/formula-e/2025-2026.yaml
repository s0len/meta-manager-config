              date: January 10, 2026. Listed start: 00:00:00 (UTC). The Mexico City ePrix is an annual race of the
              single-seater, electrically powered Formula E championship, held in Mexico City, Mexico. It was

              a very different form to the version used in Formula One. The layout is just over two kilometers in
              length, and is based on a modified version of the one-mile short oval used in the NASCAR Mexico
              Series. It utilises the full Peraltada final corner, whereas the exit of the Foro Sol section is
              next to the entrance. 45 minutes plus one lap of all-electric racing with Attack Mode strategy and
