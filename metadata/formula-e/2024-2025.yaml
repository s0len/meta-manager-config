              Race for Monaco (E-Prix 6) at Circuit de Monaco (Monte Carlo, Monaco). Scheduled date: May 03, 2025.
              Listed start: 00:00:00 (UTC). The Monaco ePrix is a recurring automobile race of the Formula E World
              Championship which takes place in Monte Carlo, Monaco.   On 16 April 2021, it was announced that a
              new track layout would be used for 2021 Monaco ePrix, the layout was similar to the Formula One
              layout, just there would be differences on the T1 (Sainte Devote) and T9 (Nouvelle Chicane). This
              layout had length about 3.318 km (2.062 mi); the distance of layout was increased due to the
              increase in car performance and range of Gen2 cars. However, on the week of Monaco ePrix, it was
              decided to use T1 like the Formula One circuit in order to regenerate more energy by braking.  Since
              2022, the Grand Prix layout has been used instead of the Formula E layout. 45 minutes plus one lap
              of all-electric racing with Attack Mode strategy and energy saves.

              Listed start: 00:00:00 (UTC). On 16 April 2021, it was announced that a new track layout would be
              used for 2021 Monaco ePrix, the layout was similar to the Formula One layout, just there would be
              differences on the T1 (Sainte Devote) and T9 (Nouvelle Chicane). This layout had length about 3.318
              km (2.062 mi); the distance of layout was increased due to the increase in car performance and range
              of Gen2 cars. However, on the week of Monaco ePrix, it was decided to use T1 like the Formula One
              circuit in order to regenerate more energy by braking.  Since 2022, the Grand Prix layout has been
              used instead of the Formula E layout. 45 minutes plus one lap of all-electric racing with Attack
              Mode strategy and energy saves.

              Listed start: 00:00:00 (UTC). Tokyo was one of the first cities contacted by Formula E before its
              first season, with co-founder Alberto Longo attending meetings with the Tokyo Metropolitan
              Government since 2013. The event has been seen as a way of achieving Tokyo's goal to ensure all new
              automobiles are non-gasoline by 2030, with Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike stating that "the
              championships will give momentum to spread zero-emission vehicles". After nearly a decade, a
              preliminary agreement was reached between Formula E and the Tokyo Government on 4 October 2022 to
              hold a race in the spring of 2024, with the race being officially announced on the provisional
              calendar for the 2023-24 season on 20 June 2023. The first Tokyo ePrix was won by Maximilian Günther

              Race for Berlin (E-Prix 13) at Tempelhof Airport Street Circuit (Berlin, Germany). Scheduled date:
              July 12, 2025. Local start: 11:00:00. The Berlin ePrix is an annual race of the single-seater,
              electrically powered Formula E championship, held in Berlin, Germany. It was first raced in the
              2014–15 season.  The 2015 Berlin ePrix took place at a temporary circuit at Tempelhof Airport, that
              was 2.469 km long with 17 turns. But because Tempelhof Airport was used for housing refugees in
              2016, the second edition could not take place there. The race returned to Tempelhof Airport in 2017
              with an updated layout that features 10 turns and is 2.250 km long. 45 minutes plus one lap of all-
              electric racing with Attack Mode strategy and energy saves.
