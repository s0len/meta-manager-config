              wheel brow of Charles Leclerc's car fell off during a lock-up at turn one, causing the session to be
              red flagged. At the end of Q1 Lando Norris and Logan Sargeant set the same exact time to place
              fifteenth and sixteenth, but Norris was moved through to Q2, having completed his lap before
              Sargeant. During Q2, Alexander Albon went off track at the turn 5/6/7 esses, preventing him from
              setting a time. After the first runs of Q3, Charles Leclerc was seen getting out of his Ferrari,
              sparking reliability concerns for the Monagasque's car, but he later revealed that the team made the
              decision to save a set of tires for the race. Ultimately, Max Verstappen took pole position by
              nearly two tenths of a second, with a time of 1:29.708.

              Sprint Qualifying for Belgian Grand Prix takes place at Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps (Stavelot,
              Belgium) on July 29, 2023. Local start: 12:00:00. The sprint shootout was held on 29 July 2023, and
              was scheduled at 12:00 local time (UTC+2), but was delayed by 35 minutes due to rain.    Sprint
              shootout report  The first segment, SQ1, would go underway with all cars on the intermediate
              compound. The wet track offered wildly differing fortunes for the teams. The fledging Aston Martin
              team, which had shown previous success in the season, were in much poorer form with Fernando Alonso
              only becoming the second-fastest car by session's end. Lance Stroll looked to be at threat to be
              knocked out, but would scrape past. The McLarens of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri also found
              themselves lacking the newfound pace, with Norris only making it past being the thirteenth fastest.
              Yuki Tsunoda, Valtteri Bottas, Kevin Magnussen, Zhou Guanyu and Nico Hülkenberg – the latter failing
              to take advantage of the changing conditions and being inconvenienced due to an issue with the Haas
              pit crew's front jack – were all out of the session. Meanwhile, Max Verstappen topped the session.
              The second segment, SQ2, was red-flagged due to Stroll's journey into the barriers and subsequent
              crash. He was unable to set a time. He had switched to medium tyres on a wet track and was suffering
              from a lack of grip. While Daniel Ricciardo was able to set a lap, the red flag greatly
              inconvenienced Stroll's teammate Alonso, Alexander Albon and Logan Sargeant, who were all knocked
              out – this in particular being Alonso's first time this season he could not progress to the third
              segment of a qualification. Meanwhile, George Russell barely made it out of the session once again.
              Confusion arose after the FIA was revealed to have not declared the track to have been wet during
              SQ2, which led to Stroll switching to mediums despite the wet track and subsequently crashing and
              destroying the front section of his car during his outlap. As per sprint shootout regulations, teams
              must use a specific tyre compound during each segment; mediums in SQ1 and SQ2, and softs in SQ3. The
              track was wet during the session and as such the regulation did not apply. Fifteen minutes before
              the session began, FIA sporting director Steve Nielsen announced that the track would not be
              declared wet. A previous instance of such changing conditions was displayed in the Austrian Grand
              Prix earlier in the year.    The third segment, SQ3, saw everyone put on the softs as the track
              dried out. Verstappen was only second behind Lewis Hamilton, but improved his time and achieved the
              pole position for the sprint, with his teammate Sergio Pérez in eighth. Piastri saw himself
              bettering his British Grand Prix qualifying result by qualifying second, 0.011 seconds off of
              polesitter Verstappen.

              scheduled at 16:30 local time (UTC+2), but was delayed by one hour and five minutes due to the delay
              of the sprint shootout and rain.    Sprint report  The sprint began with all cars under full wets
              after four formation laps behind the safety car. When it went into the pits, with the race now
              running to 11 laps, Oscar Piastri, Carlos Sainz Jr., Pierre Gasly, Lewis Hamilton, Sergio Pérez,
              Daniel Ricciardo, Alexander Albon, Lance Stroll, Valtteri Bottas, and Nico Hülkenberg pitted to
              switch to intermediate tires. Max Verstappen then led until the second lap, when he and everyone
              else who chose not to pit after the formation lap switched to intermediates. This meant Piastri led
              a race for the first time in his Formula One career.    On lap 3, Fernando Alonso lost control of
              his car on the curb of turn 12 and spun into the gravel. He could not recover the car, prompting his
              first retirement of the season and a safety car period to recover Alonso's car. It went in just
              before lap 6 started, and Verstappen finally passed Piastri down the Kemmel Straight after turn 4.
              Verstappen would keep the lead, which he extended to six seconds as he crossed the line.    Hamilton
              and Pérez banged wheels through turn 17 while fighting for the fourth position, leaving Hamilton
              ahead after Pérez suffered damage to his sidepod. After Pérez was overtaken by Sainz and Charles
              Leclerc, he ran into the gravel on the next lap at turn 15 and tumbled down the order before
              eventually retiring.    Max Verstappen, Oscar Piastri, and Pierre Gasly rounded out the top three.
              This is Gasly's first top-three finish since the 2021 Azerbaijan Grand Prix, and Piastri's first
              top-three finish in his Formula One career. Lewis Hamilton crossed the line in fourth but was
              dropped to seventh after a five-second time penalty for causing a collision with Pérez. This
              promoted Sainz to fourth, Leclerc to fifth, and Norris to sixth. Russell grabbed the final points-
              scoring position.

              scheduled at 17:00 local time (UTC+2), but was delayed by ten minutes due to rain.    Qualifying
              report  For the first segment (Q1), Lando Norris broke his floor as his car snapped and was on track
              to hit the wall, but he saved the car and went into the gravel instead. Meanwhile, teammate Oscar
              Piastri saw better fortunes by setting the fastest lap momentarily. Max Verstappen allegedly impeded
              Alexander Albon but no further action was taken, going on to take Piastri's spot being the fastest
              car on track. Albon, Zhou Guanyu, Logan Sargeant, Daniel Ricciardo, on his second qualifying for the
              AlphaTauri team, and Nico Hülkenberg were all knocked out. Hülkenberg's retirement was caused by his
              own car, which suffered hydraulic leaks during the session. Repairs meant he could not set another
              lap.    Intermediates continued to be the chosen rubber of the second session (Q2) before Norris
              substituted them for soft tyres. Meanwhile, Esteban Ocon ripped the right side of his front wing and
              ended up joining Yuki Tsunoda, teammate Pierre Gasly, Kevin Magnussen, who would also achieve a grid
              penalty for impeding Charles Leclerc, and the other Alfa Romeo of Valtteri Bottas all out of the
              session, which Piastri momentarily topped with Verstappen barely scraping by.    The drag reduction
              system (DRS) was made available to all drivers for the final session (Q3). Verstappen achieved pole
              position but would be impeded by a five-place grid penalty, which meant Charles Leclerc achieved the
              second pole position in 2023 for Ferrari ahead of Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton.

              Pre Sprint Show for Japanese Grand Prix takes place at Suzuka International Racing Course (Suzuka,
              Japan) on September 24, 2023. Local start: 14:00:00. The 2023 Japanese Grand Prix (officially known
              as the Formula 1 Lenovo Japanese Grand Prix 2023) was a Formula One motor race held on 24 September
              2023 at the Suzuka International Racing Course in Suzuka, Japan. It was the sixteenth round of the
              2023 Formula One World Championship.    Max Verstappen started from pole position, set the fastest
              lap and won the race for Red Bull Racing, allowing the Austrian constructor to win their sixth
              Constructors' Championship, their second consecutive win after 2022. Mathematically, the team also
              effectively secured the Drivers' Championship, with Verstappen securing the championship at the
              Qatar Grand Prix sprint event. At that point, Sergio Pérez remained in the title contest behind
              Verstappen. Additionally, Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri both finished on the podium for McLaren,
              marking the team's first double podium since the 2021 Italian Grand Prix and Piastri's first career
              podium.    Background  The event was held across the weekend of 22–24 September. It was the
              sixteenth round of the 2023 Formula One World Championship and the 48th running of the Japanese
              Grand Prix.
