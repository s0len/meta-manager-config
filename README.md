## Movies

Below you'll find the yaml config which then if used will generate the image below.

### Creates two collections which replace Plex default "New Releases" collection for Movies

These collections are a substantial improvement upon Plex defaults. New Releases shows Movies which has been added in the last 92 days to the Library AND has been Released in the last 365 days. This means in this collection you will always find the freshest media available.
Old Movies Just Added however is a collection of Movies who has been Released more then 365 days ago AND has been added to the Library in the last 30 days. This means in this collection you will find all the Movies which has just recently been added to the Library but has been around for longer then a year.

```yaml
- url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/s0len/meta-manager-config/main/collection_files/better_new_and_old_movie_releases.yml
```

![new movie releases and old movies just added](https://github.com/s0len/meta-manager-config/blob/main/images/new-movie-releases-and-old-movies-just-added.png)

### Common Sense Collection with custom posters

Creates collections for all your media inside the library and sorts it according to the age restriction based on Common Sense.

```yaml

### Fallback Network logo

This is a bit of a workaround to fill up the missing network logos by first writing a plex logo on all overlays. Then AFTER this is run we run the below `default: network` so that it is overwritten by default: network if it finds an image for the network.
**Must run before `default: network`.**

```yml
      - url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/s0len/meta-manager-config/main/overlays/network_fallback.yml
```
