        summary: >
          UFC on ESPN: Moreno vs. Erceg (also known as UFC on ESPN 64) was a mixed martial arts event produced
          by the Ultimate Fighting Championship that took place on March 29, 2025, at Arena CDMX in Mexico
          City, Mexico.    Background  The event marked the promotion's seventh visit to Mexico City and first
          since UFC Fight Night: Moreno vs. Royval 2 in February 2024.    A flyweight bout between former two-
          time UFC Flyweight Champion Brandon Moreno and former title challenger Steve Erceg headlined the
          event.    A featherweight bout between former interim UFC Featherweight Champion Yair Rodríguez and
          Diego Lopes was rumored to be the headliner of the event, but Lopes later denied the fight ever
          happened.    A women's flyweight bout between Yazmin Jauregui and Dione Barbosa was scheduled for
          this event. However, due to Jauregui not wanting to face Barbosa, Barbosa replaced by former LFA
          Women's Strawweight Champion Julia Polastri in a strawweight bout. In turn, Jauregui withdrew from
          the bout due to an injury and was replaced by another former LFA strawweight champion in Loopy
          Godinez.    A lightweight bout between Joaquim Silva and Rafa García was scheduled for this event.
          However, Silva withdrew from the fight for undisclosed reasons and was replaced by Vinc Pichel.    A
          lightweight bout between Daniel Zellhuber and Elves Brener was scheduled for this event. However,
          Brener withdrew from the fight and was replaced by former LFA Lightweight Champion Austin Hubbard.
          In turn, Zellhuber was pulled from the card due to injury and was replaced by MarQuel Mederos.    A
          middleweight bout between former interim UFC Middleweight Championship challenger (also The Ultimate
          Fighter: Team Jones vs. Team Sonnen middleweight winner) Kelvin Gastelum and Joe Pyfer was scheduled
          for this event. Despite both men weighing in for the match, the fight was cancelled the day of the
          event due to Pyfer's illness.    At the weigh-ins, Ronaldo Rodríguez weighed in at 127 pounds, one
          pound over the flyweight non-title fight limit. The bout proceeded at catchweight and Rodríguez was
          fined 20 percent of his purse which went to his opponent Kevin Borjas.

          UFC on ESPN: Machado Garry vs. Prates (also known as UFC on ESPN 66) is an upcoming mixed martial
          arts event produced by the Ultimate Fighting Championship that will take place on April 26, 2025, at
          the T-Mobile Center in Kansas City, Missouri, United States.     The event will mark the promotion's
          third visit to Kansas City and first since UFC on ESPN: Holloway vs. Allen in April 2023.    A light
          heavyweight bout between former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Jamahal Hill and former title
          challenger Khalil Rountree Jr. was scheduled to headline the event. The pairing was previously
          expected to co-headline UFC 303 in last June, but it was scrapped as Rountree withdrew from the
          event after unintentionally ingesting DHEA in a tainted supplement. On April 1, the pairing was
          scrapped once again as Hill pulled out due to a lingering leg injury.    A welterweight bout between
          Ian Machado Garry and Carlos Prates is now expected to serve as the new event headliner.    A
          featherweight bout between Giga Chikadze and David Onama was scheduled for UFC Fight Night: Emmett
          vs. Murphy, but it was moved to this event for unknown reasons.    A middleweight bout between Ikram
          Aliskerov and André Muniz is expected to take place at the event. The pair was originally scheduled
          to compete at UFC on ESPN: Perez vs. Taira in June 2024, but Muniz withdrew from the bout after he
          suffered a foot fracture. Subsequently, the bout was rescheduled for UFC Fight Night: Adesanya vs.
          Imavov in February, but it was cancelled once again as Muniz and his team had visa issues.    A
          lightweight bout between Mitch Ramirez and Ahmad Sohail Hassanzada was scheduled for this event.
          However, Ramirez withdrew from the fight due to an injury and was replaced by Evan Elder. In turn,
          Hassanzada was removed from the event after being arrested on charges of alleged sexual assault and
          was replaced by promotional newcomer Gauge Young.    A featherweight bout between Chris Gutiérrez
          and John Castañeda is scheduled for this event. They were previously scheduled to compete in a short
          notice contest at UFC 313 in March, but the bout was scrapped hours before taking place as Castañeda
          suffered an undisclosed illness.

        summary: >
          UFC 315: Muhammad vs. Della Maddalena was a mixed martial arts event produced by the Ultimate
          Fighting Championship that took place on May 10, 2025, at the Bell Centre in Montreal, Quebec,
          Canada.    Background  The event marked the promotion's eighth visit to Montreal and first since UFC
          186 in April 2015.    A UFC Welterweight Championship bout between current champion Belal Muhammad
          and Jack Della Maddalena headlined this event. Ian Machado Garry served as backup and potential
          replacement for this fight.    A UFC Women's Flyweight Championship bout between current two-time
          champion Valentina Shevchenko and Manon Fiorot took place in the co-main event.    A welterweight
          bout between former welterweight title challenger Gilbert Burns and Michael Morales was scheduled
          for UFC 314. However, the pairing was moved to this event due to undisclosed reasons. In turn, the
          bout was moved to UFC Fight Night: Burns vs. Morales to serve as the main event.    A women's
          bantamweight bout between Nora Cornolle and Hailey Cowan was expected to take place at this event.
          However, the bout was moved to UFC 314 for unknown reasons.    Gavin Tucker was expected to face Lee
          Jeong-yeong in a featherweight bout at the preliminary card. However, Tucker pulled out in late
          April due to undisclosed reasons and was replaced by Daniel Santos.    A lightweight bout between
          Benoît Saint Denis and Joel Álvarez was scheduled for this event. However, Álvarez withdrew from the
          fight due to a hand injury and was replaced by returning veteran Kyle Prepolec.    Originally
          scheduled as a bantamweight bout, the fight between former two-time UFC Featherweight Champion and
          UFC Hall of Famer (also former WEC Featherweight Champion) José Aldo and Aiemann Zahabi was moved to
          featherweight on the day of the weigh-ins, with Aldo weighing in at 143 pounds and Zahabi at 142
          pounds. After the official weigh-ins, Zahabi disclosed that his team was told Aldo's weight cut was
          going to be a problem and said he was just under 137 pounds at the time. Had he made weight, Aldo's
          weight discrepancy would have meant an automatic cancellation of the bout. Instead, Zahabi stopped
          his weight cut and had to rehydrate for a fight at featherweight so he could be close enough to
          Aldo's missed weight to avoid the fight being scrapped entirely.    In addition, at the weigh-ins,
          Bruno Silva weighed in at 187 pounds, a pound over the weight non-title fight limit. The bout
          proceeded at catchweight and Silva was fined 20 percent of his purse which went to his opponent
          Marc-André Barriault.    During the event's broadcast, former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion and UFC
          12 Heavyweight Tournament winner Vitor Belfort was announced as the next "pioneer wing" UFC Hall of
          Fame inductee during International Fight Week festivities in Las Vegas this June.

        summary: >
          UFC 316: Dvalishvili vs. O'Malley 2 was a mixed martial arts event produced by the Ultimate Fighting
          Championship that took place on June 7, 2025, at the Prudential Center, in Newark, New Jersey,
          United States.     The event marked the promotion's 11th visit to Newark and first since UFC 302 in
          June 2024.    A UFC Bantamweight Championship rematch between current champion Merab Dvalishvili and
          former champion Sean O'Malley headlined this event. The pairing previously met in September 2024 at
          UFC 306 in which Dvalishvili captured the title by unanimous decision.    A UFC Women's Bantamweight
          Championship bout between current two-time champion (also The Ultimate Fighter: Team Rousey vs. Team
          Tate bantamweight winner) Julianna Peña and the 2012 and 2016 Olympic gold medalist in judo (also
          two-time PFL women's lightweight tournament champion) Kayla Harrison co-headlined this event.    A
          bantamweight bout between former title challenger Marlon Vera and Mario Bautista was scheduled for
          this event. They were previously expected to meet at UFC Fight Night: Sandhagen vs. Figueiredo in
          May, but the pairing was moved to this event for unknown reasons. In turn, Vera pulled out in mid
          May for undisclosed reasons and was replaced by promotional newcomer and former Bellator
          Bantamweight World Champion Patchy Mix.    A flyweight bout between Bruno Gustavo da Silva and
          Joshua Van took place at this event. They were previously scheduled to compete at UFC 313 in March,
          but Silva had to withdraw due to an injury.    Serghei Spivac and Shamil Gaziev were expected to
          meet in a heavyweight bout at UFC Fight Night: Burns vs. Morales. However, the bout was moved to
          this event due to undisclosed reasons. In turn, Gaziev pulled out due to undisclosed reasons and was
          replaced by former LFA Heavyweight Champion Waldo Cortes-Acosta.    A light heavyweight bout between
          Johnny Walker and Azamat Murzakanov was scheduled for this event. They were originally scheduled for
          UFC Fight Night: Burns vs. Morales but were moved to this event for unknown reasons. However, Walker
          pulled out in early May due to injury and was replaced by Brendson Ribeiro.    Former interim UFC
          Middleweight Championship challenger (also The Ultimate Fighter: Team Jones vs. Team Sonnen
          middleweight winner) Kelvin Gastelum and Joe Pyfer fought in a middleweight bout at this event. They
          were previously scheduled to meet at UFC on ESPN: Moreno vs. Erceg in March, but the fight was
          cancelled on the day of the event as Pyfer had to withdraw due to an illness.    Uroš Medić was
          expected to meet Khaos Williams in a welterweight bout on the preliminary card. However, Medić
          pulled out in late May due to sinusitis and was replaced by promotional newcomer Albert Tadevosyan.
          In turn, Tadevosyan did not pass his medical tests, so Williams instead faced another newcomer in
          Andreas Gustafsson, who was originally scheduled to compete at UFC on ESPN: Gamrot vs. Klein one
          week before.    At the weigh-ins, Ariane da Silva weighed in at 132 pounds, six pounds over the
          flyweight non-title fight limit. Her bout with Wang Cong proceeded at catchweight and she was fined
          25 percent of her purse which went to Wang.    During the event's broadcast, two-time UFC
          Heavyweight Tournament winner (UFC 14 and UFC 15) Mark Kerr was announced as the next "pioneer wing"
          and final UFC Hall of Fame inductee of this year during International Fight Week festivities in Las
          Vegas this June.

        summary: >
          A light heavyweight bout between former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Jamahal Hill and former title
          challenger Khalil Rountree Jr. is scheduled to headline the event. The pairing was originally
          expected to meet at UFC 303 in June 2024, but the bout was scrapped as Rountree withdrew from the
          event after unintentionally ingesting DHEA in a tainted supplement. They were then booked to
          headline UFC on ESPN: Machado Garry vs. Prates in April, but Hill pulled out due to a lingering leg
          injury.    The co-main event would feature a flyweight bout between Tagir Ulanbekov and former UFC
          Flyweight Championship challenger Kyoji Horiguchi (who is also a former RIZIN Flyweight and two-time
          RIZIN Bantamweight Champion, as well as former Bellator Bantamweight World Champion). Horiguchi
          would make his promotional return for the first time since November 2016. In turn, Horiguchi pulled
          out for undisclosed reasons and was replaced by Azat Maksum.    A heavyweight bout between former
          interim UFC Heavyweight Championship challenger Curtis Blaydes and promotional newcomer Rizvan
          Kuniev is scheduled for this event. The pairing was originally scheduled for UFC Fight Night: Cejudo
          vs. Song, then shifted to UFC 313 and eventually cancelled a few hours before the event after
          Blaydes had to pull out due to an undisclosed illness. The bout was later rescheduled for UFC Fight
          Night: Burns vs. Morales but was subsequently moved to this event for unknown reasons.    Another
          couple of fights were also scheduled for UFC Fight Night: Burns vs. Morales and moved to this event
          due to undisclosed reasons: a middleweight bout between Park Jun-yong and Ismail Naurdiev and a
          heavyweight bout between Hamdy Abdelwahab and The Ultimate Fighter: Team Peña vs. Team Nunes
          heavyweight winner Mohammed Usman.    Originally slated as a lightweight bout, the fight between
          newcomer Tofiq Musayev and Myktybek Orolbai will proceed at a catchweight of 165 pounds. There was
          no indication of why and when the change was made, but both competitors exceeded the lightweight
          non-title fight limit during the weigh-ins, with Musayev weighing 163 pounds and Orolbai 165 pounds.

          The event will be held during the UFC's annual International Fight Week. The 2025 UFC Hall of Fame
          induction ceremony is also expected to take place during the week.    A UFC Lightweight Championship
          bout for the vacant title between former UFC Featherweight Champion Ilia Topuria and former champion
          Charles Oliveira is expected to serve as the event's headliner. Current champion Islam Makhachev
          will vacate the title in order to challenge for the UFC Welterweight Championship. Topuria vacated
          his featherweight title in April in order to move up to lightweight. Arman Tsarukyan (who was
          previously scheduled to challenge for the title at UFC 311 but pulled out a day before the event due
          to injury) is expected to serve as backup and potential replacement for this fight.    A UFC
          Flyweight Championship bout between current champion Alexandre Pantoja and former interim title
          challenger Kai Kara-France is scheduled to co-headline the event. The bout was originally rumored to
          take place at UFC 314 and UFC 316, but the bookings were never confirmed. The pairing previously met
          in an exhibition match in the quarterfinals of The Ultimate Fighter: Tournament of Champions in
          November 2016, when Pantoja won the two-round bout by unanimous decision.    A flyweight bout
          between former UFC Flyweight Championship challenger (also former LFA Flyweight Champion) Brandon
          Royval and former RIZIN Bantamweight Champion Manel Kape was scheduled to take part at this event.
          They were originally scheduled to headline UFC Fight Night: Kape vs. Almabayev in a title
          eliminator, but Royval had to withdraw due to multiple concussions. In turn, Kape pulled out this
          time on June 9 due to a broken foot and was replaced by Joshua Van.    A lightweight bout between
          Beneil Dariush and former title challenger Renato Moicano is scheduled for this event. They were
          initially supposed to compete at UFC 311 but Moicano ended up challenging Makhachev for the title in
          the main event on short notice.    A heavyweight bout between Justin Tafa and Jhonata Diniz was
          scheduled for this event. However, Tafa withdrew from the fight for unknown reasons and was replaced
          by promotional newcomer Alvin Hines.    A middleweight bout between former UFC Middleweight
          Championship challenger Paulo Costa and Roman Kopylov was scheduled for this event. However, for
          unknown reasons the bout was moved to UFC 318.

        summary: >
          UFC 318: Holloway vs. Poirier 3 was a mixed martial arts event produced by the Ultimate Fighting
          Championship that took place on July 19, 2025, at the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans,
          Louisiana, United States.    Background  The event marked the promotion's sixth visit to New Orleans
          and first since UFC Fight Night: Boetsch vs. Henderson in June 2015.    Former UFC Featherweight
          Champion Max Holloway put his symbolic "BMF" (baddest motherfucker) title on the line against former
          interim UFC Lightweight Champion Dustin Poirier in a lightweight bout in the main event. This was
          their third meeting and Poirier's retirement fight. The pairing first met at UFC 143 in February
          2012, when Holloway made his promotional debut and lost by a triangle-armbar submission. Their
          second outing was in April 2019 at UFC 236 when Poirier became the interim lightweight champion
          after winning via unanimous decision, which also ended Holloway's 13-fight win streak.    A
          middleweight bout between former UFC Middleweight Championship challenger Marvin Vettori and former
          LFA Middleweight Champion Brendan Allen took place in the preliminary card of the event. The pairing
          was previously scheduled to headline UFC Fight Night: Allen vs. Curtis 2 in April 2024, but Vettori
          withdrew due to an injury.    A welterweight bout between Islam Dulatov and Adam Fugitt took place
          at the event. The pairing was previously scheduled to meet at UFC Fight Night: Cejudo vs. Song in
          last February, but Dulatov was forced to withdraw due to a serious injury.    A welterweight bout
          between Neil Magny and Gunnar Nelson was scheduled for this event. They were previously scheduled to
          meet in May 2018 at UFC Fight Night: Thompson vs. Till but Nelson was forced to withdraw due to a
          knee injury. In turn, two weeks prior to the event, it was reported that Nelson withdrew again due
          to a hamstring injury, so the bout was cancelled and Magny was moved to the UFC on ESPN: Albazi vs.
          Taira two weeks later with a different opponent.    A light heavyweight bout between Jimmy Crute and
          Marcin Prachnio took place at the event. They were originally scheduled to compete in February at
          UFC 312 but Prachnio had to withdraw from the fight for unknown reasons.    A middleweight bout
          between Ateba Abega Gautier and Robert Valentin took place at this event. They were briefly
          scheduled to compete at UFC on ESPN: Lewis vs. Teixeira one week prior, but the pairing was moved to
          this event for unknown reasons.    A women's strawweight bout between Amanda Ribas and Tabatha Ricci
          was scheduled for this event. However, the bout was moved to UFC on ABC: Whittaker vs. de Ridder one
          week later for unknown reasons.    A middleweight bout between former title challenger Paulo Costa
          and Roman Kopylov was scheduled for UFC 317. However the bout was moved to this event for unknown
          reasons.    Kevin Holland and Daniel Rodriguez met in a welterweight bout at this event. The pairing
          was first booked at UFC Fight Night: Woodley vs. Burns in May 2020, but Holland pulled out due to
          injury. They were then expected to meet again in September 2022 at UFC 279 in a catchweight bout of
          180 pounds. However, the promotion opted to book them on short notice against different opponents at
          the same event, mainly due to Khamzat Chimaev missing weight by nearly 10 pounds for his headliner
          bout (Holland and Chimaev ended up facing each other in the co-main event).    A middleweight bout
          between Ikram Aliskerov and Brunno Ferreira was scheduled for this event. However, on June 30,
          Aliskerov withdrew from the fight due to a broken toe and was replaced by promotional newcomer
          Jackson McVey.

        summary: >
          UFC 319: du Plessis vs. Chimaev was a mixed martial arts event produced by the Ultimate Fighting
          Championship that took place on August 16, 2025, at the United Center in Chicago, Illinois, United
          States.    Background  The event marked the promotion's eighth visit to Chicago and first since UFC
          238 in June 2019.    A UFC Middleweight Championship bout between current champion (also former KSW
          Welterweight Champion) Dricus du Plessis and undefeated contender Khamzat Chimaev headlined the
          event. Nassourdine Imavov was expected to serve as backup and potential replacement for this fight,
          but he announced a month later that it would not be the case anymore as he was angling for a fight
          against Caio Borralho. In turn, Borralho announced that he would be the new backup for the main
          event. He and Imavov are still scheduled to headline UFC Fight Night: Imavov vs. Borralho three
          weeks later.    A welterweight bout between Geoff Neal and Carlos Prates took place at this event.
          They were originally scheduled to meet at UFC 314 in April, but Neal had to withdraw from the fight
          due to an injury.    A women's flyweight bout between Karine Silva and JJ Aldrich was scheduled for
          this event. However, Aldrich withdrew from the fight for undisclosed reasons and was replaced by
          Dione Barbosa.    The flyweight final of The Ultimate Fighter: Team Cormier vs. Team Sonnen took
          place at this event. The welterweight final between Rodrigo Sezinando and Daniil Donchenko was
          scheduled for the event but was moved to UFC Fight Night: Lopes vs. Silva one month later due to an
          injury suffered from Sezinando's side.    King Green and Carlos Diego Ferreira were expected to meet
          in a lightweight bout on the preliminary card. However, Green suffered an undisclosed injury during
          fight week and the pairing was scrapped.    At the weigh-ins, The Return of The Ultimate Fighter:
          Team Volkanovski vs. Team Ortega middleweight tournament winner Bryan Battle weighed in at 190
          pounds, four pounds over the middleweight non-title fight limit. His bout with Nursulton Ruziboev
          was scheduled to proceed at catchweight, however shortly thereafter, it was announced that the bout
          had been cancelled.

        summary: >
          UFC Fight Night: Walker vs. Zhang (also known as UFC Fight Night 257 and UFC on ESPN+ 115) was a
          mixed martial arts event produced by the Ultimate Fighting Championship that took place on August
          23, 2025, at the Shanghai Indoor Stadium in Shanghai, China.    Background  The event marked the
          promotion's second visit to Shanghai and first since UFC Fight Night: Bisping vs. Gastelum in
          November 2017. It was also the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic that the UFC has returned to
          Mainland China. The promotion was originally expected to make their return to the location at UFC
          Fight Night: Song vs. Gutiérrez in December 2023, before moving that event to Las Vegas due to
          undisclosed reasons.    A light heavyweight bout between Johnny Walker and Zhang Mingyang headlined
          this event.    A catchweight bout between former UFC Featherweight Championship challenger Brian
          Ortega and former UFC Bantamweight Champion Aljamain Sterling took place in a five round co-
          headliner. Originally slated as a featherweight bout, it was changed to a catchweight of 153 pounds
          after reports that Ortega had complications during his weight cut.    Shi Ming and Bruna Brasil were
          expected to meet in a women's strawweight bout at the event. However, the pairing was pulled in
          order to serve as the featured bout of the Road to UFC Season 4 semifinals event a day earlier.    A
          welterweight bout between Song Kenan and Kiefer Crosbie was scheduled for this event. However, Song
          withdrew from the fight for unknown reasons and was replaced by promotional newcomer Taiyilake
          Nueraji.    In addition, a middleweight bout between Michel Pereira and Marco Tulio was also
          scheduled for this event. However, Tulio withdrew from the fight for unknown reasons and was
          replaced by returning veteran Kyle Daukaus.

        summary: >
          UFC Fight Night: Imavov vs. Borralho (also known as UFC Fight Night 258 and UFC on ESPN+ 116) was a
          mixed martial arts event produced by the Ultimate Fighting Championship that took place on September
          6, 2025, at the Accor Arena in Paris, France.    Background  The event marked the promotion's fourth
          consecutive annual visit to Paris and first since UFC Fight Night: Moicano vs. Saint Denis in
          September 2024.    A middleweight bout between Nassourdine Imavov and Caio Borralho headlined the
          event.    A women's flyweight bout between promotional newcomer Kennedy Freeman and Yuneisy Duben
          was scheduled for this event. However, both Duben and Freeman had to withdraw due to injury, so the
          bout was subsequently cancelled.    A lightweight bout between Farès Ziam and Kauê Fernandes was
          scheduled for this event. However, Ziam withdrew for personal reasons following the death of his
          grandmother and was replaced by promotional newcomer Harry Hardwick.    Former three-time Bellator
          Featherweight World Champion (also one-time Bellator Lightweight World Champion) Patrício Pitbull
          and promotional newcomer Losene Keita were expected to meet in a featherweight bout at the main
          card. However, at the weigh-ins, Keita weighed in at 149 pounds, three pounds over the division's
          non-title fight limit, resulting in the cancellation of the bout.

        summary: >
          Noche UFC: Lopes vs. Silva (also known as UFC Fight Night 259 and Noche UFC 3 and UFC on ESPN+ 117)
          was a mixed martial arts event produced by the Ultimate Fighting Championship that took place on
          September 13, 2025, at the Frost Bank Center in San Antonio, Texas, United States.    Background
          The event marked the promotion's fourth visit to San Antonio and first since UFC on ESPN: Vera vs.
          Sandhagen in March 2023.    It was the third annual "Noche UFC" event commemorating Mexico's
          independence day, following September 2023's UFC Fight Night: Grasso vs. Shevchenko 2 and September
          2024's UFC 306. The card was originally expected to take place in Guadalajara, Mexico and serve as
          UFC 320, but it was moved to San Antonio (and shifted to a Fight Night event) due to the
          construction of Arena Guadalajara being stalled.    A featherweight bout between former UFC
          Featherweight Championship challenger Diego Lopes and Jean Silva headlined the event.    Rob Font
          and Raul Rosas Jr. were scheduled to meet in a bantamweight bout in the co-main event. However,
          Rosas Jr. withdrew due to a rib injury and was replaced by David Martínez. Martínez was originally
          expected to face Carlos Vera at this event, before the latter withdrew and was replaced by Quang Le.
          Following Martínez's reassignment to the co-main event, Le was matched with promotional newcomer
          Santiago Luna.    A women's strawweight bout between former UFC Women's Strawweight Championship
          challengers Amanda Lemos and Tatiana Suarez (also The Ultimate Fighter: Team Joanna vs. Team Cláudia
          strawweight winner) took place at this event. They were originally scheduled to meet at UFC 298 in
          February 2024, but Suarez withdrew from the event due to an injury.    Sedriques Dumas and Zachary
          Reese met in a middleweight bout at the event. They were originally scheduled to meet at UFC 311 in
          January, but Dumas withdrew from the event for unknown reasons.    Édgar Cháirez was expected to
          face Alessandro Costa in a flyweight bout at the event. However, Cháirez pulled out in late July due
          to a broken leg and was replaced by Alden Coria.    A women's bantamweight bout between former UFC
          Women's Bantamweight Champion Raquel Pennington and Norma Dumont was scheduled for this event.
          However, Pennington had to withdraw due to an undisclosed injury, so the bout was removed from the
          card.    The welterweight final of The Ultimate Fighter: Team Cormier vs. Team Sonnen between
          Rodrigo Sezinando and Daniil Donchenko took place at the event. They were initially scheduled to
          compete at UFC 319 one month before, but the bout was shifted to this card due to an injury suffered
          from Sezinando's side.    At the weigh-ins, former interim UFC Middleweight Championship challenger
          (also The Ultimate Fighter: Team Jones vs. Team Sonnen middleweight winner) Kelvin Gastelum weighed
          in at 191 pounds, five pounds over the middleweight non-title fight limit. The bout proceeded at
          catchweight and he was fined 35 percent of his purse which went to his opponent Dustin Stoltzfus.

        summary: >
          UFC Fight Night: Ulberg vs. Reyes (also known as UFC Fight Night 260 and UFC on ESPN+ 118) was a
          mixed martial arts event produced by the Ultimate Fighting Championship that took place on September
          28, 2025, at the RAC Arena in Perth, Australia.    Background  This event marked the promotion's
          fourth visit to Perth and its first-ever Fight Night, following UFC 305 in August 2024.    A light
          heavyweight bout between Carlos Ulberg and former UFC Light Heavyweight Championship challenger
          Dominick Reyes headlined this event. The pairing was initially scheduled for UFC 297 in January
          2024, but was cancelled due to an injury sustained by Ulberg. It was later rebooked for UFC on ESPN:
          Blanchfield vs. Fiorot in March 2024; however, Reyes withdrew from the bout due to deep vein
          thrombosis.    A featherweight bout between Choi Doo-ho and Daniel Santos was scheduled for this
          event. However, Choi withdrew from the fight for unknown reasons and was replaced by Yoo Joo-sang.
          In turn, the pairing was moved to UFC 320 due to undisclosed reasons.    Tom Nolan and Evan Elder
          were expected to meet in a lightweight bout at the event. However, Elder pulled out and was replaced
          by Charlie Campbell.    A light heavyweight bout between Junior Tafa and İbo Aslan was scheduled for
          this event. However, the bout was canceled after Tafa sustained an injury.    Oban Elliott was
          expected to meet Jonathan Micallef in a welterweight bout on the preliminary card, but the pairing
          was cancelled less than 48 hours before the event as Elliott pulled out due to illness.    At the
          weigh-ins, Ramon Taveras weighed in at 147 pounds, one pound over the featherweight non-title fight
          limit. The bout proceeded at catchweight and he was fined a percentage of his purse, which went to
          his opponent Jack Jenkins. In addition, the heavyweight fight between Justin Tafa and Louie
          Sutherland was removed from the event due to Tafa suffering an illness.

          UFC Fight Night: Bonfim vs. Brown (also known as UFC on ESPN 73 and UFC Vegas 111) is an upcoming
          mixed martial arts event produced by the Ultimate Fighting Championship that will take place on
          November 8, 2025, at the UFC Apex in Enterprise, Nevada, part of the Las Vegas Valley, United
          States.    A welterweight bout between former LFA Welterweight Champion Gabriel Bonfim and Randy
          Brown is scheduled to headline the event. They were originally scheduled to compete at UFC Fight
          Night: Oliveira vs. Gamrot one month before, but the bout was moved to this event in order to serve
          as the main event.    Austin Bashi was expected to face Jamall Emmers in a featherweight bout at the
          event. However, Bashi pulled out due to an injury and was replaced by Hyder Amil.    A women's
          bantamweight bout between Luana Santos and Dariya Zheleznyakova was scheduled for this event.
          However, Zheleznyakova withdrew from the fight for unknown reasons and was replaced by Melissa
          Croden. The rescheduled bout between Santos and Croden was later moved to UFC on ESPN: Royval vs.
          Kape in December.    A bantamweight bout between former LFA Bantamweight Champion Miles Johns and
          Daniel Marcos is scheduled for this event. Johns was initially booked to face fellow former LFA
          champion Muin Gafurov one week prior at UFC Fight Night: Garcia vs. Onama, but Gafurov withdrew for
          undisclosed reasons. Meanwhile, Marcos was slated to fight Felipe Lima at UFC Fight Night: Tsarukyan
          vs. Hooker on November 22, until Lima also withdrew. Following both cancellations, Johns and Marcos
          were rebooked to face each other at this event.    A bantamweight bout between Adrian Yañez and
          Cristian Quiñónez was scheduled for this event. However during fight week, Quiñónez withdrew from
          the bout for unknown reasons and the bout was subsequently cancelled.    In addition, Robert
          Valentin withdrew from his middleweight bout against Jackson McVey due to a back injury. Undefeated
          prospect Donte Johnson was initially considered as a replacement, having competed a week earlier at
          UFC Fight Night: Garcia vs. Onama, in a 190-pound catchweight bout. However, the Nevada State
          Athletic Commission declined the substitution because Johnson was under a two-week medical
          suspension. As a result, Zachary Reese stepped in to face McVey in a catchweight bout at 195 pounds.

        summary: >
          UFC 322: Della Maddalena vs. Makhachev (branded as VeChain UFC 322 for sponsorship reasons) is an
          upcoming mixed martial arts event produced by the Ultimate Fighting Championship that will take
          place on November 15, 2025, at Madison Square Garden in New York City, New York, United States.
          Background  The event will mark the promotion's 12th visit to New York City and first since UFC 309
          in November 2024.    A UFC Welterweight Championship bout between current champion Jack Della
          Maddalena and former UFC Lightweight Champion Islam Makhachev is scheduled to headline the event.
          Makhachev vacated his lightweight title in May in order to move up to welterweight.    In addition,
          a UFC Women's Flyweight Championship bout between current two-time champion Valentina Shevchenko and
          current two-time UFC Women's Strawweight Champion Zhang Weili is scheduled to co-headline the event.
          Zhang vacated her strawweight title in order to challenge for the flyweight title.    A bantamweight
          bout between Malcolm Wellmaker and Serhiy Sidey was scheduled for this event. However, Sidey
          withdrew due to a shoulder injury and was replaced by Cody Haddon. Two days before the event, Haddon
          also withdrew due to an injury and was replaced by promotional newcomer Ethyn Ewing. The bout was
          subsequently shifted to the featherweight division.    At the weigh-ins, Beneil Dariush weighed in
          at 157.2 pounds, 1.2 pounds over the lightweight non-title fight limit. The bout is expected to
          proceed at catchweight and he will be fined 20 percent of his purse, which will go to his opponent
          Benoît Saint Denis.
