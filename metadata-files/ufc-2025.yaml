          UFC on ESPN: Moreno vs. Erceg (also known as UFC on ESPN 64) was a mixed martial arts event produced
          by the Ultimate Fighting Championship that took place on March 29, 2025, at Arena CDMX in Mexico
          City, Mexico.    Background  The event marked the promotion's seventh visit to Mexico City and first
          since UFC Fight Night: Moreno vs. Royval 2 in February 2024.    A flyweight bout between former two-
          time UFC Flyweight Champion Brandon Moreno and former title challenger Steve Erceg headlined the
          event.    A featherweight bout between former interim UFC Featherweight Champion Yair Rodríguez and
          Diego Lopes was rumored to be the headliner of the event, but Lopes later denied the fight ever
          happened.    A women's flyweight bout between Yazmin Jauregui and Dione Barbosa was scheduled for
          this event. However, due to Jauregui not wanting to face Barbosa, Barbosa replaced by former LFA
          Women's Strawweight Champion Julia Polastri in a strawweight bout. In turn, Jauregui withdrew from
          the bout due to an injury and was replaced by another former LFA strawweight champion in Loopy
          Godinez.    A lightweight bout between Joaquim Silva and Rafa García was scheduled for this event.
          However, Silva withdrew from the fight for undisclosed reasons and was replaced by Vinc Pichel.    A
          lightweight bout between Daniel Zellhuber and Elves Brener was scheduled for this event. However,
          Brener withdrew from the fight and was replaced by former LFA Lightweight Champion Austin Hubbard.
          In turn, Zellhuber was pulled from the card due to injury and was replaced by MarQuel Mederos.    A
          middleweight bout between former interim UFC Middleweight Championship challenger (also The Ultimate
          Fighter: Team Jones vs. Team Sonnen middleweight winner) Kelvin Gastelum and Joe Pyfer was scheduled
          for this event. Despite both men weighing in for the match, the fight was cancelled the day of the
          event due to Pyfer's illness.    At the weigh-ins, Ronaldo Rodríguez weighed in at 127 pounds, one
          pound over the flyweight non-title fight limit. The bout proceeded at catchweight and Rodríguez was
          fined 20 percent of his purse which went to his opponent Kevin Borjas.

          UFC on ESPN: Machado Garry vs. Prates (also known as UFC on ESPN 66) is an upcoming mixed martial
          arts event produced by the Ultimate Fighting Championship that will take place on April 26, 2025, at
          the T-Mobile Center in Kansas City, Missouri, United States.     The event will mark the promotion's
          third visit to Kansas City and first since UFC on ESPN: Holloway vs. Allen in April 2023.    A light
          heavyweight bout between former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Jamahal Hill and former title
          challenger Khalil Rountree Jr. was scheduled to headline the event. The pairing was previously
          expected to co-headline UFC 303 in last June, but it was scrapped as Rountree withdrew from the
          event after unintentionally ingesting DHEA in a tainted supplement. On April 1, the pairing was
          scrapped once again as Hill pulled out due to a lingering leg injury.    A welterweight bout between
          Ian Machado Garry and Carlos Prates is now expected to serve as the new event headliner.    A
          featherweight bout between Giga Chikadze and David Onama was scheduled for UFC Fight Night: Emmett
          vs. Murphy, but it was moved to this event for unknown reasons.    A middleweight bout between Ikram
          Aliskerov and André Muniz is expected to take place at the event. The pair was originally scheduled
          to compete at UFC on ESPN: Perez vs. Taira in June 2024, but Muniz withdrew from the bout after he
          suffered a foot fracture. Subsequently, the bout was rescheduled for UFC Fight Night: Adesanya vs.
          Imavov in February, but it was cancelled once again as Muniz and his team had visa issues.    A
          lightweight bout between Mitch Ramirez and Ahmad Sohail Hassanzada was scheduled for this event.
          However, Ramirez withdrew from the fight due to an injury and was replaced by Evan Elder. In turn,
          Hassanzada was removed from the event after being arrested on charges of alleged sexual assault and
          was replaced by promotional newcomer Gauge Young.    A featherweight bout between Chris Gutiérrez
          and John Castañeda is scheduled for this event. They were previously scheduled to compete in a short
          notice contest at UFC 313 in March, but the bout was scrapped hours before taking place as Castañeda
          suffered an undisclosed illness.
