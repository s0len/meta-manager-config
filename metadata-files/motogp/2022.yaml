              Practice One for Grand Prix of Qatar takes place at Losail International Circuit (Doha, Qatar) on
              March 06, 2022. Listed start: 15:00:00 (UTC). The Qatar motorcycle Grand Prix is a motorcycling
              event that is part of the FIM Grand Prix motorcycle racing season.  The Losail race track in Qatar
              represents the debut race of each MotoGP season. In 2008, the track held the first night event in
              MotoGP history. The 2008 night event, aside from drawing boosted viewing which also coincided with
              the race being moved to the opening spot on the calendar, was initiated with the intent of
              increasing equipment performance: the day-time heat in Qatar has been hazardous to the conditions of
              tires and expensive, customized parts on the multimillion-dollar motorcycles. Rider safety
              notwithstanding, the extreme heat could be a critical variable contributing to defeat.

              Race for Motorrad Grand Prix Deutschland takes place at Sachsenring (Hohenstein-Ernstthal, Germany)
              on June 19, 2022. Listed start: 00:00:00 (UTC). The German motorcycle Grand Prix, first held in
              1925, is since 1952 part of the Grand Prix motorcycle racing World Championship.  The first two
              Großer Preis von Deutschland races were held at Berlin's AVUS before moving to the new the purpose-
              built Nürburgring which was used in its full 28 km configuration. No GP was held in 1932, in 1933
              the AVUS was given another try, and since 1934, public roads near and through Hohenstein-Ernstthal
              in Saxony were in use, initially without the name Sachsenring which had been used elsewhere. It was
              adopted in 1937.  In 1998, after having become rather unpopular first at Hockenheim and then at
              Nürburgring due to the style of the promoters, the German motorcycle Grand Prix moved to new
              promoters, and to the shortened purpose-built Sachsenring where it became a sell-out event since.

              Practice One for Grand Prix of Finland takes place at KymiRing (Kausala, Finland) on July 10, 2022.
              Listed start: 12:00:00 (UTC). The Finnish motorcycle Grand Prix is a round of the FIM Grand Prix
              motorcycle racing championship from 1962 to 1982. It was held at the Tampere Circuit in 1962 and
              1963 before moving to the Imatra Circuit. Giacomo Agostini won the most Finnish Grands Prix with ten
              500cc victories and seven 350cc victories.     Homologation works at the KymiRing, together with the
              risks caused by the ongoing geopolitical situation in the region, have sadly obliged the
              cancellation of the Finnish Grand Prix in 2022. The current circumstances have created delays and
              put the ongoing work at the new circuit at risk. All parties have therefore agreed that the track’s
              debut must be postponed to 2023, when MotoGP™ looks forward to returning to Finland for the first

              Practice One for British Grand Prix takes place at Silverstone Circuit (Silverstone, United Kingdom)
              on August 07, 2022. Local start: 13:00:00. The British motorcycle Grand Prix is a motorcycling event
              that is part of the Grand Prix motorcycle racing season.   Before 1977, the only British round was
              the Isle of Man TT, which was part of the FIM championship from its inauguration in 1949 until 1976.
              The Isle of Man TT was the most prestigious event on the Grand Prix motorcycling calendar from 1949
              to 1972. After the 1972 event, multiple world champion Giacomo Agostini dropped a bombshell on the
              motorsports world by stating he would never race at the Isle of Man TT again, saying the 37-mile (62
              km) circuit was too dangerous for international competition. His friend Gilberto Parlotti was killed
              during the event. Many riders followed Agostini's boycotting of the next four events, and after the
              1976 season, the Isle of Man TT was scratched from the FIM calendar.  The inaugural British
              motorcycle Grand Prix, the first motorcycle Grand Prix to be held on the British mainland, took
              place at the Silverstone Circuit. The event was moved to Donington Park in 1987 before returning to
              Silverstone in 2010.

              the Isle of Man TT, which was part of the FIM championship from its inauguration in 1949 until 1976.
              The Isle of Man TT was the most prestigious event on the Grand Prix motorcycling calendar from 1949
              to 1972. After the 1972 event, multiple world champion Giacomo Agostini dropped a bombshell on the
              motorsports world by stating he would never race at the Isle of Man TT again, saying the 37-mile (62
              km) circuit was too dangerous for international competition. His friend Gilberto Parlotti was killed
              during the event. Many riders followed Agostini's boycotting of the next four events, and after the
              1976 season, the Isle of Man TT was scratched from the FIM calendar.  The inaugural British
              motorcycle Grand Prix, the first motorcycle Grand Prix to be held on the British mainland, took
              place at the Silverstone Circuit. The event was moved to Donington Park in 1987 before returning to
              Silverstone in 2010.

              Qualifying Two for Gran Premio di San Marino e della Riviera di Rimini takes place at Misano World
              Circuit Marco Simoncelli (Misano Adriatico, Italy) on September 04, 2022. Local start: 14:00:00. The
              San Marino and Rimini Riviera Grand Prix is a motorcycling event that is part of the World
              Motorcycle Racing season. The name of the race is a misnomer as the race has always taken place in
              Italy, but because there is already an Italian motorcycle Grand Prix, it was called the San Marino
              Grand Prix because of the track location's proximity to San Marino.  The 2021 San Marino and Rimini
              Riviera motorcycle Grand Prix (officially known as the Gran Premio Octo di San Marino e della
              Riviera di Rimini) was the fourteenth round of the 2021 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season and the
              sixth and seventh round of the 2021 MotoE World Cup, which represented the end of the season for the
              MotoE class. It was held at the Misano World Circuit Marco Simoncelli in Misano Adriatico on 19
              September 2021.

              Practice One for Grand Prix of Japan takes place at Twin Ring Motegi (Motegi, Japan) on September

              years was the Suzuka Circuit, until it permanently was replaced by the Twin Ring Motegi from 2004
              onwards after the circuit faced criticism for its short runoff area's and dangerous trackside
              barriers, causing the death of Japanese rider Daijiro Kato and the injuries of Marco Melandri and
              Alex Barros at the 2003 Japanese Grand Prix. As a result, Suzuka was faced with making considerable
              safety alterations to avoid a possible strike by the riders – many of whom believed the 240 hp
              motorbikes had outgrown the tight circuit. The FIM stated that the modifications would not be
              completed before 2005 and that, therefore, the 2004 Japanese Grand Prix would be held at the Twin
              Ring Motegi, but the circuit has not subsequently appeared on the calendar.  The 2020 and 2021 races

              a round of the FIM Grand Prix motorcycle racing World Championship.   The first Malaysian Grand Prix
              was held in 1991 at the Shah Alam Circuit as the final race of the season. Because of the long trip
              and high cost, many riders chose to not participate in this event. The 500cc race was won by John
              Kocinski. The event was notorious due to the tropical temperatures and a high degree of humidity,
              something which plagued the riders for four consecutive years – from 1992 to 1995 respectively.  In
              1999 the Sepang International Circuit, designed by Hermann Tilke, had finished construction. The
              circuit was not only more modern and purpose-built compared to Johor, it also lay close to Kuala
              Lumpur International Airport. As a result, the race for that season was moved to Sepang along with
              Formula One, who held its first race at the country in the same year. Since 1999, the Sepang circuit
              has hosted the Malaysian GP every year until 2020.  In 2020, the Malaysian round was cancelled due
              to the COVID-19 pandemic.
