              Practice One for Tissot Sprint Race takes place at Algarve International Circuit (Portimão,
              Portugal) on March 25, 2023. Listed start: 00:00:00 (UTC). For the first time in MotoGP history,
              sprint races will feature on the grand prix bill in 2023 at every round on the calendar.  The Sprint
              lasts roughly half the amount of time of Sunday’s race, which will vary from Grand Prix to Grand
              Prix. So, if Sunday’s race is 20 laps for example, then the Sprint will be 10 laps. Championship
              points will be awarded differently to Sunday too, with 12 points handed out to the winner, going all
              the way down to one point for the top nine finishers.

              Großer Preis von Deutschland races were held at Berlin's AVUS before moving to the new the purpose-
              built Nürburgring which was used in its full 28 km configuration. No GP was held in 1932, in 1933
              the AVUS was given another try, and since 1934, public roads near and through Hohenstein-Ernstthal
              in Saxony were in use, initially without the name Sachsenring which had been used elsewhere. It was
              adopted in 1937.  In 1998, after having become rather unpopular first at Hockenheim and then at
              Nürburgring due to the style of the promoters, the German motorcycle Grand Prix moved to new
              promoters, and to the shortened purpose-built Sachsenring where it became a sell-out event since.

              motorcycling calendar from 1949 to 1972. After the 1972 event, multiple world champion Giacomo
              Agostini dropped a bombshell on the motorsports world by stating he would never race at the Isle of
              Man TT again, saying the 37-mile (62 km) circuit was too dangerous for international competition.
              His friend Gilberto Parlotti was killed during the event. Many riders followed Agostini's boycotting
              of the next four events, and after the 1976 season, the Isle of Man TT was scratched from the FIM
              calendar.  The inaugural British motorcycle Grand Prix, the first motorcycle Grand Prix to be held

              Sprint for CryptoDATA Motorrad Grand Prix von Österreich takes place at Red Bull Ring (Spielberg,
              Styria, Austria) on August 20, 2023. Local start: 00:00:00. The Austrian motorcycle Grand Prix
              (Motorrad Grand Prix von Österreich) is a motorcycling event that was part of the Grand Prix
              motorcycle racing season from 1971 to 1997, and then again from 2016 onwards.  The inaugural
              Austrian grand prix was held in 1971 at the Salzburgring, where it stayed until 1994. In 1995, the
              Austrian GP was taken off the calendar because the Salzburgring was deemed too dangerous for
              racing., but would return in 1996 on the then-called Österreichring. In 1997, the Österreichring
              became the A1-Ring, named after the Austrian mobile network operator A1.  For the 1998 season, the
              Austrian round was scrapped, mainly due to the low number of spectators who visited the races.
              After a 19-year absence, the Austrian Grand Prix returned in 2016 and currently takes place at the
              Red Bull Ring in Spielberg.

              Practice One for Motul Grand Prix of Japan takes place at Mobility Resort Motegi (Motegi, Tochigi

              a motorcycling event that is part of the Grand Prix motorcycle racing season.  The main venue who
              held the races for years was the Suzuka Circuit, until it permanently was replaced by the Twin Ring
              Motegi from 2004 onwards after the circuit faced criticism for its short runoff area's and dangerous
              trackside barriers, causing the death of Japanese rider Daijiro Kato and the injuries of Marco
              Melandri and Alex Barros at the 2003 Japanese Grand Prix. As a result, Suzuka was faced with making
              considerable safety alterations to avoid a possible strike by the riders – many of whom believed the
              240 hp motorbikes had outgrown the tight circuit. The FIM stated that the modifications would not be
              completed before 2005 and that, therefore, the 2004 Japanese Grand Prix would be held at the Twin
              Ring Motegi, but the circuit has not subsequently appeared on the calendar.  The 2020 and 2021 races
              were cancelled due to the outbreak of COVID-19.

              from the 1998 calendar.  In February 2019, it was announced that the Indonesian GP would return in
              2021 to be held at the Mandalika International Street Circuit, then under construction in the
              Mandalika resort area of Central Lombok Regency, West Nusa Tenggara. The track, claimed to be a
              street circuit, is the first in Grand Prix motorcycle racing since the Brno Circuit last staged a
              Grand Prix as a street circuit in 1986. The Grand Prix races were subsequently postponed until 2022
              due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Pertamina is the title sponsor of this event until 2024.

              Practice One for PETRONAS Grand Prix of Malaysia takes place at Sepang International Circuit
              (Sepang, Malaysia) on November 12, 2023. Local start: 00:00:00. The Malaysian motorcycle Grand Prix
              is a round of the FIM Grand Prix motorcycle racing World Championship.  The first Malaysian Grand
              Prix was held in 1991 at the Shah Alam Circuit as the final race of the season. Because of the long
              trip and high cost, many riders chose to not participate in this event. The 500cc race was won by
              John Kocinski. The event was notorious due to the tropical temperatures and a high degree of
              humidity, something which plagued the riders for four consecutive years – from 1992 to 1995
              respectively.  In 1999 the Sepang International Circuit, designed by Hermann Tilke, had finished
              construction. The circuit was not only more modern and purpose-built compared to Johor, it also lay
              close to Kuala Lumpur International Airport. As a result, the race for that season was moved to
              Sepang along with Formula One, who held its first race at the country in the same year. Since 1999,
              the Sepang circuit has hosted the Malaysian GP every year until 2020.  In 2020, the Malaysian round
              was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

              round of the FIM Grand Prix motorcycle racing World Championship.  The first Malaysian Grand Prix
              was held in 1991 at the Shah Alam Circuit as the final race of the season. Because of the long trip
              and high cost, many riders chose to not participate in this event. The 500cc race was won by John
              Kocinski. The event was notorious due to the tropical temperatures and a high degree of humidity,
              something which plagued the riders for four consecutive years – from 1992 to 1995 respectively.  In
              1999 the Sepang International Circuit, designed by Hermann Tilke, had finished construction. The
              circuit was not only more modern and purpose-built compared to Johor, it also lay close to Kuala
              Lumpur International Airport. As a result, the race for that season was moved to Sepang along with
              Formula One, who held its first race at the country in the same year. Since 1999, the Sepang circuit
              has hosted the Malaysian GP every year until 2020.  In 2020, the Malaysian round was cancelled due
              to the COVID-19 pandemic.

              represents the debut race of each MotoGP season. In 2008, the track held the first night event in
              MotoGP history. The 2008 night event, aside from drawing boosted viewing which also coincided with
              the race being moved to the opening spot on the calendar, was initiated with the intent of
              increasing equipment performance: the day-time heat in Qatar has been hazardous to the conditions of
              tires and expensive, customized parts on the multimillion-dollar motorcycles. Rider safety
              notwithstanding, the extreme heat could be a critical variable contributing to defeat. Qatar's Grand
              Prix is the only event in the entire MotoGP calendar to be held at night.  The 2020 MotoGP race was
              scheduled to open the season before being cancelled due to the outbreak of Coronavirus. The Moto2
              and Moto3 classes proceeded as planned.  The event is due to take place at the Losail International
