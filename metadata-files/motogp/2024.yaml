              Practice One for Grand Prix of Qatar takes place at Lusail International Circuit (Lusail, Qatar) on
              March 10, 2024. Local start: 20:00:00. The Qatar motorcycle Grand Prix is a motorcycling event that
              is part of the FIM Grand Prix motorcycle racing season.  The Losail race track in Qatar represents
              the debut race of each MotoGP season. In 2008, the track held the first night event in MotoGP
              history. The 2008 night event, aside from drawing boosted viewing which also coincided with the race
              being moved to the opening spot on the calendar, was initiated with the intent of increasing
              equipment performance: the day-time heat in Qatar has been hazardous to the conditions of tires and
              expensive, customized parts on the multimillion-dollar motorcycles. Rider safety notwithstanding,
              the extreme heat could be a critical variable contributing to defeat. Qatar's Grand Prix is the only
              event in the entire MotoGP calendar to be held at night.  The 2020 MotoGP race was scheduled to open
              the season before being cancelled due to the outbreak of Coronavirus. The Moto2 and Moto3 classes
              proceeded as planned.  The event is due to take place at the Losail International Circuit until at
              least 2031.

              Practice One for Grande Prémio de Portugal takes place at Algarve International Circuit (Portimão,

              motorcycling road racing event that is part of the MotoGP World Championship.  The event was first
              held in 1987 at the Jarama circuit in Spain. The reason for this was because the main Portuguese
              circuit at the time, the Circuito do Estoril, was not yet ready to be used for motorcycle racing.
              However, Portugal still wanted to host a round in the championship that year and so opted to use the
              Jarama circuit until their own was ready for use.  In 2000, Grand Prix motorcycle racing returned to
              Portugal after the Estoril Circuit was homologated for international motorcycle racing. This was the
              third time Portugal hosted a grand prix but only the first time a race was held in the country
              itself. Estoril continued to host the Portuguese round until 2012, where it was confirmed for the
              final time after the owners of the Estoril circuit and the Portuguese government came to an
              agreement.

              1925, is a motorcycling event that is part of the FIM Grand Prix motorcycle racing season. The event
              is due to take place at the Sachsenring until at least 2026.  In 1998, after having become rather
              unpopular first at Hockenheim and then at Nürburgring due to the style of the promoters, the German
              motorcycle Grand Prix moved to new promoters, and to the shortened purpose-built Sachsenring where
              it became a sell-out event since.

              Practice One for British Grand Prix takes place at Silverstone Circuit (Silverstone, United Kingdom)
              on August 04, 2024. Local start: 13:00:00. The British motorcycle Grand Prix is a motorcycling event
              that is part of the Grand Prix motorcycle racing season.  Before 1977, the only British round was
              the Isle of Man TT, which was part of the FIM championship from its inauguration in 1949 until 1976.
              The Isle of Man TT was the most prestigious event on the Grand Prix motorcycling calendar from 1949
              to 1972. After the 1972 event, multiple world champion Giacomo Agostini dropped a bombshell on the
              motorsports world by stating he would never race at the Isle of Man TT again, saying the 37-mile (62
              km) circuit was too dangerous for international competition. His friend Gilberto Parlotti was killed
              during the event. Many riders followed Agostini's boycotting of the next four events, and after the
              1976 season, the Isle of Man TT was scratched from the FIM calendar.  The inaugural British
              motorcycle Grand Prix, the first motorcycle Grand Prix to be held on the British mainland, took
              place at the Silverstone Circuit. The event was moved to Donington Park in 1987 before returning to
              Silverstone in 2010.

              Qualifying Two for Motorrad Grand Prix von Österreich takes place at Red Bull Ring (Spielberg,
              Austria) on August 18, 2024. Local start: 14:00:00. The Austrian motorcycle Grand Prix is a
              motorcycling event that is part of the FIM Grand Prix motorcycle racing season from 1971 to 1997,
              and then again from 2016 onwards. The event is due to take place at the Red Bull Ring until at least
              2025.The inaugural Austrian grand prix was held in 1971 at the Salzburgring, where it stayed until
              1994. In 1995, the Austrian GP was taken off the calendar because the Salzburgring was deemed too
              dangerous for racing., but would return in 1996 on the then-called Österreichring. In 1997, the
              Österreichring became the A1-Ring, named after the Austrian mobile network operator A1.  For the
              1998 season, the Austrian round was scrapped, mainly due to the low number of spectators who visited
              the races.  After a 19-year absence, the Austrian Grand Prix returned in 2016 and currently takes
              place at the Red Bull Ring in Spielberg. The layout was changed, and a chicane was added before the
              2022 race.

              Indonesian motorcycle Grand Prix is a motorcycling event that is part of the FIM Grand Prix
              motorcycle racing season. There have been four Grand Prix events held; in 1996 and 1997, both at the
              Sentul International Circuit, Bogor, West Java, and since 2022 at the Pertamina Mandalika
              International Street Circuit, Central Lombok, West Nusa Tenggara.  As a response to the 1997 Asian
              financial crisis, this race was dropped from the 1998 calendar.  In February 2019, it was announced
              that the Indonesian GP would return in 2021 to be held at the Mandalika International Street
              Circuit, then under construction in the Mandalika resort area of Central Lombok Regency, West Nusa
              Tenggara. The track, claimed to be a street circuit, is the first in Grand Prix motorcycle racing
              since the Brno Circuit last staged a Grand Prix as a street circuit in 1986. The Grand Prix races
              were subsequently postponed until 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic

              onwards after the circuit faced criticism for its short runoff area's and dangerous trackside
              barriers, causing the death of Japanese rider Daijiro Kato and the injuries of Marco Melandri and
              Alex Barros at the 2003 Japanese Grand Prix. As a result, Suzuka was faced with making considerable
              safety alterations to avoid a possible strike by the riders – many of whom believed the 240 hp
              motorbikes had outgrown the tight circuit. The FIM stated that the modifications would not be
              completed before 2005 and that, therefore, the 2004 Japanese Grand Prix would be held at the Twin
              Ring Motegi, but the circuit has not subsequently appeared on the calendar.  The 2020 and 2021 races

              of the Grand Prix motorcycle racing season.  The main venue who held the races for years was the
              Suzuka Circuit, until it permanently was replaced by the Twin Ring Motegi from 2004 onwards after
              the circuit faced criticism for its short runoff area's and dangerous trackside barriers, causing
              the death of Japanese rider Daijiro Kato and the injuries of Marco Melandri and Alex Barros at the
              2003 Japanese Grand Prix. As a result, Suzuka was faced with making considerable safety alterations
              to avoid a possible strike by the riders – many of whom believed the 240 hp motorbikes had outgrown
              the tight circuit. The FIM stated that the modifications would not be completed before 2005 and
              that, therefore, the 2004 Japanese Grand Prix would be held at the Twin Ring Motegi, but the circuit
              has not subsequently appeared on the calendar.  The 2020 and 2021 races were cancelled due to the
              outbreak of COVID-19.

              Malaysian Grand Prix was held in 1991 at the Shah Alam Circuit as the final race of the season.
              Because of the long trip and high cost, many riders chose to not participate in this event. The
              500cc race was won by John Kocinski. The event was notorious due to the tropical temperatures and a
              high degree of humidity, something which plagued the riders for four consecutive years – from 1992
              to 1995 respectively.
