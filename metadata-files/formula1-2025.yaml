        summary: The Hungaroring near Budapest hosts the Hungarian Grand Prix, often one of the hottest races of the season. This 4.4 km circuit features a series of medium-speed corners with few straights, making overtaking challenging and placing emphasis on qualifying position and strategy. The track's tight, twisty nature has earned it the nickname "Monaco without the walls," while its dusty surface off the racing line and high summer temperatures create a physically demanding race that tests both drivers and cooling systems.
