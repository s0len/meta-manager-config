          UFC Fight Night: Ankalaev vs. Walker 2 (also known as UFC Fight Night 234, UFC on ESPN+ 92 and UFC
          Vegas 84) was a mixed martial arts event produced by the Ultimate Fighting Championship that took
          place on January 13, 2024, at the UFC Apex facility, in Enterprise, Nevada, part of the Las Vegas
          Metropolitan Area, United States.    Background  A light heavyweight rematch between former UFC
          Light Heavyweight Championship challenger Magomed Ankalaev and Johnny Walker headlined the event.
          The pairing originally met at UFC 294 which ended in a no contest when Ankalaev landed an illegal
          knee that rendered Walker unable to continue.    Former LFA Featherweight Champion Gabriel Santos
          and Westin Wilson were expected to meet in a featherweight bout. However, Santos pulled out due to
          undisclosed reasons and was replaced by promotional newcomer Jean Silva.    Bassil Hafez and Preston
          Parsons were scheduled to meet in a welterweight bout. However, Hafez pulled out due to undisclosed
          reasons and was replaced by Matthew Semelsberger.    A women's bantamweight bout between former
          Invicta FC Bantamweight Champion and UFC Women's Featherweight Championship challenger Yana Santos
          and Norma Dumont was expected to take place at the event. However, Santos pulled out due to a broken
          nose and the bout was scrapped.    A flyweight bout between former LFA Flyweight Champion Felipe
          Bunes and Denys Bondar was also scheduled for the preliminary portion of the event. However, Bondar
          pulled out in late December due to undisclosed reasons and was replaced by Joshua Van.    A women’s
          bantamweight bout between Ketlen Vieira and The Ultimate Fighter: Heavy Hitters women's
          featherweight winner Macy Chiasson was expected to take place at the event. However, Vieira was
          pulled for unknown reasons and the bout was scrapped.    Former Rizin Bantamweight Champion Manel
          Kape was expected to face Matheus Nicolau in a flyweight rematch at the co-main event. The pairing
          previously met at UFC Fight Night: Edwards vs. Muhammad in March 2021, where Nicolau won the fight
          via controversial split decision. However at the weigh-ins, Kape weighed in at 129.5 pounds, three
          and a half pounds over the flyweight non-title fight limit. As a result, the bout was cancelled.

        summary: >
          After a lackluster start to the year, fans will be thrilled with the action-packed fight card that
          FC 298 brings to Anaheim, California on Saturday night. In the main event, champion Alexander
          Volkanovski will try to defeat Ilia Topuria, his most recent opponent, to win the featherweight
          belt. Incredibly, Volkanovski has maintained the championship for more than four years after losing
          two bouts against lightweight champion Islam Makhachev.    Volkanovski hasn't faced this level of
          uncertainty for a featherweight championship defense in a long time. Before visiting the Honda
          Center in Anaheim, Volkanovski is a small favorite in the betting. Though some believe him to be the
          best featherweight in MMA, it's a close call since he's up against one of the fastest-rising talents
          in the division. Topuria is a formidable featherweight fighter who has won 14 straight bouts by
          knockout. Even from that distance, damage is certain. Just ask Josh Emmett, against whom Topuria
          earned his championship shot with an unbelievable 50-42 scoreline. The fact that Volkanovski
          recovered quite quickly from Makhachev's October head kick further heightens worries.

        summary: >
          UFC 300: Pereira vs. Hill is an upcoming mixed martial arts event produced by the Ultimate Fighting
          Championship that will take place on April 13, 2024, at the T-Mobile Arena in Paradise, Nevada, part
          of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Area, United States.    Background    After hosting UFC 200 in 2016,
          T-Mobile Arena will host another milestone event, which will be its 28th UFC event overall.  A UFC
          Light Heavyweight Championship bout between current champion Alex Pereira (also former UFC
          Middleweight Champion and former Glory Middleweight and Light Heavyweight Champion) and former
          champion Jamahal Hill will headline the event. The fight was verbally agreed for UFC 301 three weeks
          later, but the promotion opted to book it at this card. Pereira won the vacant title at UFC 295
          against former champion Jiří Procházka after Hill was forced to vacate it in July 2023 due to a
          ruptured Achilles tendon.    A UFC Women's Strawweight Championship bout between current two-time
          champion Zhang Weili and Yan Xiaonan is expected to take place at the event. It will mark the first
          time two Chinese-born athletes will meet for a title in the organization.    Former interim UFC
          Lightweight Champion Justin Gaethje (also former WSOF Lightweight Champion) is expected to defend
          his symbolic "BMF" (baddest motherfucker) title against former UFC Featherweight Champion Max
          Holloway in a lightweight bout. Gaethje won the symbolic title at UFC 291 defeating fellow former
          interim champion Dustin Poirier by second round knockout in what was their second meeting.    Former
          UFC Lightweight Champion Charles Oliveira and Arman Tsarukyan are scheduled to meet in a lightweight
          title eliminator bout.    Former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Jiří Procházka (also the inaugural
          Rizin Light Heavyweight Champion) and Aleksandar Rakić are expected to meet in a light heavyweight
          bout at the event.    Former UFC Bantamweight Champion Aljamain Sterling is expected to make his
          promotional debut at featherweight against Calvin Kattar.    A middleweight bout between three-time
          NCAA Division I National Wrestling Champion and undefeated prospect Bo Nickal and Cody Brundage is
          expected to take place at the event.    A bantamweight bout between former UFC Bantamweight Champion
          Cody Garbrandt and former two-time UFC Flyweight Champion Deiveson Figueiredo is expected to take
          place at the event. The pairing was previously scheduled to meet at UFC 255 in November 2020 for the
          flyweight title but Garbrandt withdrew due to a torn bicep.    2012 and 2016 Olympic gold medalist
          in judo (also two-time PFL women's lightweight tournament champion) Kayla Harrison is expected to
          make her promotional debut, as well as her bantamweight debut, against former UFC Women's
          Bantamweight Champion (also International Boxing Hall of Famer) Holly Holm.    A featherweight bout
          between Sodiq Yusuff and Diego Lopes is expected to take place at the event.    Former UFC Women's
          Strawweight Champion Jéssica Andrade and Marina Rodriguez are expected to meet in a women's
          strawweight bout.    Jim Miller and Bobby Green are expected to meet in a lightweight bout at the
          event. Miller will become the only fighter to have competed at all three milestone events for the
          organization, previously competing at UFC 100 and UFC 200. The duo was previously booked thrice, but
          canceled all three times due to Green withdrawals: first at UFC 172 in April 2014, due to an elbow
          injury; the second booking at UFC 258 in February 2021, when he collapsed after the weigh-ins and
          was deemed unfit to compete; and the third time at UFC 276 in July 2022, when Green withdrew for
          unknown reasons.

        summary: >
          UFC 301: Pantoja vs. Erceg was a mixed martial arts event produced by the Ultimate Fighting
          Championship that took place on May 4, 2024, at the Farmasi Arena, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
          Background  The event marked the promotion's 12th visit to Rio de Janeiro and first since UFC 283 in
          January 2023.    A UFC Flyweight Championship bout between current champion Alexandre Pantoja and
          Steve Erceg headlined the event.    Former WEC Featherweight Champion and two-time UFC Featherweight
          Champion José Aldo made his return in a bantamweight bout against Jonathan Martinez, after retiring
          in September 2022.    A lightweight bout between Ismael Bonfim and Vinc Pichel is expected to take
          place at the event. The pair was previously expected to meet at UFC Fight Night: Almeida vs. Lewis
          but the bout was scrapped after Bonfim missed weight.    A middleweight bout between Michel Pereira
          and Makhmud Muradov was expected to take place at the event. However, Muradov withdrew due to an
          infection. He was replaced by Ihor Potieria, who is also scheduled to compete against Sharabutdin
          Magomedov at UFC on ABC: Whittaker vs. Chimaev on June 22.    A featherweight bout between Jean
          Silva and William Gomis was scheduled for this event. However, the bout was eventually cancelled due
          to Gomis suffering a weight cut related illness.    During the event's broadcast, former UFC Light
          Heavyweight Champion (also the 2005 PRIDE Middleweight Grand Prix Champion) Maurício Rua was
          announced as the next "pioneer wing" UFC Hall of Fame inductee during June's International Fight
          Week festivities in Las Vegas. Rua was already a UFC Hall of Famer himself after a light heavyweight
          bout that took place in November 2011 at UFC 139 against the former PRIDE Welterweight, PRIDE
          Middleweight and former Strikeforce Light Heavyweight Champion Dan Henderson (also a former UFC
          Middleweight and Light Heavyweight title challenger) was inducted in the "fight wing" section as
          part of the 2018 class.

          UFC 302: Makhachev vs. Poirier was a mixed martial arts event produced by the Ultimate Fighting
          Championship that took place on June 1, 2024, at the Prudential Center, in Newark, New Jersey,
          United States.    Background  The event marked the promotion's tenth visit to Newark and first since
          UFC 288 in May 2023.    A UFC Lightweight Championship bout between current champion Islam Makhachev
          and former interim champion Dustin Poirier headlined the event.    A five-round middleweight bout
          between former UFC Middleweight Champion Sean Strickland and former title challenger Paulo Costa
          took place in the co-main event.    A heavyweight bout between former Bellator Heavyweight World
          Champion Alexander Volkov and Jailton Almeida was expected to take place at this event. However, the
          bout was scrapped for unknown reasons and Volkov was booked for UFC on ABC: Whittaker vs. Chimaev
          against former interim UFC Heavyweight Championship challenger Sergei Pavlovich. Almeida faced
          Alexander Romanov instead.    A women's strawweight bout between former Invicta FC Atomweight
          Champion Michelle Waterson-Gomez and Gillian Robertson was scheduled for the event. However, the
          bout was postponed to UFC 303 for unknown reasons.    Jeremiah Wells was expected to face Niko Price
          in a welterweight bout. However, Wells pulled out due to undisclosed reasons and was replaced by
          Alex Morono. Price and Morono previously met at UFC Fight Night: Bermudez vs. The Korean Zombie in
          February 2017, with the bout originally ending via second round knockout for Price, before
          ultimately being overturned to a no contest due to him testing positive for marijuana.    Su
          Mudaerji and Joshua Van were expected to meet in a flyweight bout at this event. However, Su pulled
          out in late April due to undisclosed reasons. He was replaced by Tatsuro Taira. In turn, both
          fighters were moved to UFC Fight Night: Perez vs. Taira in order to face different opponents.    A
          middleweight bout between Roman Dolidze and former LFA Middleweight Champion Anthony Hernandez was
          scheduled to take place at the event. However, Hernandez was forced out of the bout due to a torn
          ligament in his hand.    Road to UFC Season 2 flyweight winner Park Hyun-sung was expected to face
          André Lima. However, he pulled out due to a knee injury and was replaced by promotional newcomer
          Nyamjargal Tumendemberel. In turn, Tumendemberel was forced to withdraw from the event due to visa
          issues and was replaced by Mitch Raposo. At the weigh ins, Lima weighed in at 130 pounds, four
          pounds over the flyweight non-title fight limit. The bout proceeded at catchweight and he was fined
          30 percent of his purse which went to Raposo.
